I'm Taylor Faires. I'm currently the Digital Scholarship Librarian at the University of Chicago, where I assists students, faculty, and staff with their projects relating to digital technologies. I also manage the DIY Digitization Lab, a self-serve lab for text-based digitization and personal archiving projects. My academic work focuses on topics randing from media and performance Studies, digital pedadogy, cultural memory, online communities, and disinformation. If you're interested in collaborating on a project, please feel free to reach out!
<br><br>
I entered into the field of Digital Scholarship during a post-baccalaureate fellowship at Barnard College, where I helped run the Collegeâ€™s new Digital Humanities Center: consulting with students and faculty on digital scholarship projects, designing programming on digital pedagogy, and creating a public-facing digital book on gender and identity performance in fan communities, The Girl, The Myth, The Fanfiction. I have experience

Outside of work, you can find me trying to find good hiking around Chicago, writing poetry and music, reading mystery novels, or listening to podcasts.
